### Approximate linear models for CO_2 at Mauna Loa, Hawaii

This plot shows measurements of monthly-averaged CO_2 concentrations (in ppm) at the
Mauna Loa Observatory between 1958 and 2020. An adjustable linear trend is also plotted. 

**Instructions:**
- Adjust the slope and intercept of the linear trend so the straight line "fits" the *first 5 years* of data. 
    - Adjust "Signal type" and "Plot segment" to refine your fit. 
    - Click a slider, then use keyboard left/right arrows to "slide" the control. 
    - Note the value for "Predicted CO_2 for 2030" (the graph's title).
- Do the same to make the line fit the *most recent* 5 years of data. 
    - Note the new value for "Predicted CO_2 for 2030".
- Do your two linear models predict the same CO2 concentrations for the year 2030? 
- Small icons between controls and graph have mouse-over tool tips.
