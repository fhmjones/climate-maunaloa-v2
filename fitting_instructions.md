### Fitting Instructions
- Use sliders to adjust the slope and intercept of the straight line. Or - click the slider then use keyboard arrow keys to move the value. 
- Adjust the line to match a chosen portion of the data as closely as possible. 
- Set a _Prediction Year_ and "predicted" CO_2 based simply on your straight line is given. 

**Example activity:** Adjust the line to "fit" the first 5-10 years, then note the predicted CO2 for 2030. Repeat for the last 5-10 yrs of data. 
- Do these two linear "models" predict the same CO2 concentrations for the year 2030? 
- How different is predicted CO2? What are implications of using a straight line model for predictions? 
- Out to which year would you trust this simple linear model as a predictor, if it was "fitted" to just the data between 1958 and 1965? 
- How far out would you trust the model predictions with the model built for 2015 - 2020? Would you trust the model to predict CO2 for the year 2050?
